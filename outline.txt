Battle Plan!

- Checker class
	- player (string) (could be the color)
	- square (int x, int y)
	- crowned (bool)
	

- Game Loop while both players have more than 1 piece left
	- Player chooses piece
		- Piece must belong to the current player
	- Code identifies valid squares to move to (and maybe highlights them)
		- If there are no valid squares then prevent movement
	- Player moves valid piece
	- Remove competitor piece if captured
	- Crown king if necessary
	- Check for game end
